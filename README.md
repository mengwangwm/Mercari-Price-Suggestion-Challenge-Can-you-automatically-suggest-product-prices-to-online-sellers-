# Mercari-Price-Suggestion-Challenge-Can-you-automatically-suggest-product-prices-to-online-sellers

Machine Learning Project: Price Suggestion based on user-inputted text descriptions of their products

• Constructed ML algorithms that automatically suggests the right product prices based on user-inputted text descripted dataset with 1.5 million observations and 7 different variables.
• Collaborated with whole team to clean and transform numeric, categorical and text variables into the format that can be used in machine learning models
• Conducted Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Light GBM and Neural Network, and selected the stacking linear regression model by comparing models’ in-sample RMSE performances, then performed stacking model on test data with a RMSE score of 25.9960.
